Artist Statement

SMU Sandbox is a piece rendered in Autodesk Maya and utilizes JavaScript, CSS, HTML and After Effects for environmental setup. SMU Sandbox reflects on the many different chapters throughout Bloom’s college career. The piece explores a variety of different mood shifts as each milestone displays visual aesthetics that align with its own story. Each milestone was carefully crafted in Maya and rendered using Arnold lighting and textures. The models are each sculpted and textured using Maya’s modeling toolkit. Although Seasons specifically reflects on Bloom’s personal experience, the ambiguity of the 3D models allows for interpretation beyond what has been provided. Bloom implores all viewers to apply their own personal stories to the piece as they are representative of the human experience and is relatable to many. 
  
Project Description

According to the Merriam-Webster English Dictionary, the word 'capstone' is defined as "the high point : crowning achievement." A capstone is a culmination of many things: what has been learned, what has been done, and what will be done going forward. The best way to demonstrate such things is to illustrate the journey leading up to the capstone. The rest speaks for itself.
